Objective 1 - Extra Credit pursued:
	- used google font (Open Sans on h1)
	- used font-stacks (added monospace as final backup font)
	- used fully semantic HTML (in this exercise it was limitied though, ie no sidebar etc but I would add these if part of
		the design)
	- attempted fully responsive with meta tag, but I am not quite understanding column wrapping outside of bootstrap

Objective 4 - response comparing/contrasting own grid vs bootstrap:

When comparing my own 12 column grid to bootstrap, I found that the 12 column grid requires much more modifying to get
precision down with the html layout. Bootstrap appeared to be more seamless, although I have not mastered bootstrap so it
is hard to tell based on the idiosyncracies of each. I found it simplier to build responsiveness by using bootstrap. When
constructing your own 12 column grid, you have to build in the responsiveness carefully vs using bootstrap's built in functions.
Using a 12 column grid is like making a recipe from scratch, whereas bootstrap is like using a pre-built meal kit (I always like
to use food as an analogy!).

I think that the scale of the project would determine which one should be used. For example, I think if I were building a
simply site that did not need a complex UI I would go with my own 12 grid system. If it was a complex application I think I
would use bootstrap. I can see how bootstrap is so popular, as it has all of the bells and whistles needed to build a 
responsive website. In order to fully leverage bootstrap, it would be necessary to know all of the details of how it operates.
I did find it difficult to setup Bootstrap's navigation button for responsiveness, but found setting up columns for responsiveness 
easy and seamless.
