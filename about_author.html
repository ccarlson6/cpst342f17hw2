<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>This page describes more about me, such as my career interests and personal hobbies. I was born and raised in Northern California and currently reside in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois.
    <br>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois. When I am not busy working or taking classes at Loyola, I enjoy
    <br>traveling internationally and throughout the United States. I also enjoy photography and seeing new things!
<p>Below is an example of a photograph I took during a recent trip to the Olympic Peninsula along the Washington Coastline! I have included a link below to my personal photography site if
<br>you would like to view more!</p>
